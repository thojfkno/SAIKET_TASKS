Task 3: Customer Segmentation and Churn Analysis
🎯 Objective:
To segment customers using features like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type, and then analyze churn behavior across different customer segments.

🔧 Step-by-Step Process

1️⃣ Data Preparation
Columns selected: tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract, Churn.

Ensured data quality by checking for:

Missing values.

Data type mismatches.

Outliers (e.g., extremely high charges or tenure).

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation
📌 Approach Used:
Used K-Means Clustering on tenure and MonthlyCharges for numerical segmentation.

Contract Type included as a categorical feature (encoded).

Standardized numerical features for better clustering performance.

🧪 Example Code:
python

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd

# One-hot encode contract type
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Contract'], drop_first=True)

# Features for clustering
X = df_encoded[['tenure', 'MonthlyCharges', 'Contract_One year', 'Contract_Two year']]

# Standardize
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Apply K-Means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
df['Segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

3️⃣ Churn Rate Analysis by Segment
📊 Segment-Wise Churn Rate:
python

segment_churn = df.groupby('Segment')['Churn'].value_counts(normalize=True).unstack().fillna(0)
segment_churn['Churn Rate'] = segment_churn['Yes']

✅ Key Observations:
Segments with high monthly charges and low tenure showed higher churn rates.

Customers on month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn.

Segments with long tenure and yearly/two-year contracts had low churn.

🔍 Insights Gained:
Segment	Tenure	MonthlyCharges	Contract Type	Churn Trend
0	Low	High	Month-to-month	🔺 High churn
1	High	Low	Two-year	🔻 Low churn
2	Mid	Mid	One-year	Moderate churn
3	Low	Low	Month-to-month	Moderate to high churn
