Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔍 Description:
Perform exploratory data analysis on a customer dataset to:

Calculate and visualize overall churn rate.

Explore customer distribution by demographics.

Analyze tenure distribution.

Investigate relationships between churn and contract types/payment methods.

🔧 Step-by-Step Process

1️⃣ Calculate & Visualize Overall Churn Rate
📊 Code Example:
python


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate churn rate
churn_counts = df['Churn'].value_counts(normalize=True)
churn_rate = churn_counts['Yes'] * 100

# Plot churn distribution
sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
plt.title(f"Overall Churn Rate: {churn_rate:.2f}%")
plt.ylabel("Number of Customers")
plt.show()

✅ Insight:
The churn rate is a critical KPI.

Helps understand the magnitude of customer retention issues.

2️⃣ Customer Distribution by Demographics
📌 Demographic Features Analyzed:
Gender

SeniorCitizen

Partner

Dependents

📊 Visualization Example:
python

# Gender-wise distribution
sns.countplot(x='gender', hue='Churn', data=df)
plt.title("Churn by Gender")
plt.show()
Repeat similar visualizations for other demographics.

✅ Insights:
Check if senior citizens churn more.

Analyze how dependents or having a partner influences churn behavior.

3️⃣ Tenure Distribution Analysis
📊 Histogram and KDE Plot:
python

sns.histplot(df['tenure'], kde=True, bins=30)
plt.title("Tenure Distribution")
plt.xlabel("Months")
plt.show()
✅ Insight:
Identifies peak tenure lengths.

Useful for understanding customer lifecycle and retention timeframes.

4️⃣ Churn by Contract Type and Payment Method
📊 Grouped Bar Plots:
python

# Contract Type
sns.countplot(x='Contract', hue='Churn', data=df)
plt.title("Churn by Contract Type")
plt.show()

# Payment Method
sns.countplot(x='PaymentMethod', hue='Churn', data=df)
plt.title("Churn by Payment Method")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
✅ Insight:
Month-to-month customers show higher churn.

Certain payment methods (e.g., electronic check) may be associated with higher churn.
